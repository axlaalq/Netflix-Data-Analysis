# Netflix Data Analysis

This project performs a data analysis using information about different movies and series released on Netflix. It includes data cleaning, analysis, and visualization processes. Additionally, as an extra, a predictive model for future trends is included.

## Project Contents

### Data Loading and Cleaning

* Loading the CSV file in Python using the `pandas` library.
* Identifying and handling missing values (NaN) using techniques such as imputation or deletion.
* Removing duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.
* Transforming and optimizing data types for better performance and analysis (e.g., converting dates to datetime format).

### Exploratory Analysis

* Calculating descriptive statistics of movies and series (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) using `pandas`.
* Identifying key trends in the data, such as the evolution of content production over time.

### Data Visualization

* Creating graphs to visualize releases by decade and type (movie/series) using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
* Identifying and visualizing the most common genres on Netflix.
* Analyzing and visualizing the countries with the most movies and series on the platform.
* Identifying and visualizing the most popular actors in Netflix productions.
* Visualizing the evolution of releases over time using line or area charts.

### Predictions with Polynomial Regression

* Implementing a predictive model using polynomial regression to estimate future releases.
* Visualizing the trend of releases on Netflix and the model's prediction.

## Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Programming language:** `Python`
* **Libraries:** `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Scikit-learn`
* **Development environment:** `Google Colab`

## How to Use the Project

**Run the code:** Follow the instructions within the notebook named `Examen-Integrity.ipynb` to execute the code cells and generate the results.

## Main Results

* A growing trend in content production on Netflix is observed.
* The most common genre is international movie drama.
* The United States (USA) is the country with the most movies and series on Netflix, by a wide margin.
* **Prediction:** A significant increase in Netflix releases is expected in the coming year (an estimated value is provided).
